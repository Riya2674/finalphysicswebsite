          <p>‚ÄúDear ashutosh sir,
            The two years that we spent with you were the most memorable ones. It is your positive attitude and lively lectures that I will always remember.
            Physics was always easy to understand because of you.
            Thank you, sir, for teaching us.‚Äù</p>

          <p>‚ÄúThe Institute wasn't just a physics tuition but a second home during these two memorable years... Ashutosh Sir, Bhagwan Bhai, Nihal Sir, Jayraj Sir and all the faculty members treated us like a family... It was the best studying experience till date... Ashu sir is the perfect definition of a 'GURU' who teaches you the subject with important religious and spiritual beliefs... During these two years we waited for all the Wednesdays and Saturdays because it was an amazing vibe there.. It's really hard to believe that this journey came to end!! It was just unforgettable.
            Thank's a lot sirüôè‚Äù</p>
